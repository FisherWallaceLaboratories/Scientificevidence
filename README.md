# Fisher Wallace Laboratories

Fisher Wallace Laboratories is a wearable medical device company.  The company's flagship product, the Fisher Wallace Stimulator, is FDA-Cleared to treat depression, anxiety and insomnia and works by electrically stimulating the brain to produce neurotransmitters and to better regulate the limbic system. The device has also been shown to improve focus and concentration.

# Multiple clinical trials have been performed using the Fisher Wallace Stimulator and devices deemed similar for research purposes.
